# Odyssey Parallax

This module integrates with [Odyssey](https://stash.abc-dev.net.au/projects/NEWS/repos/odyssey/browse) to implement parallax sections in Odyssey based stories.

To use this, include it in the story:

```
Some text before the parallax portion of the story starts.

#parallax
[link to your HTML fragment containing images]
#endparallax

You can then carry on your story after the parallax section.
```
