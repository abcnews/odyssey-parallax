            <p>Taking them out of harm's way might seem like the obvious option. But removing them can place them
              <a href="/news/2016-11-14/four-corners-broken-homes-child-protection/7987450" target="_self" title="">at risk in Australia's child protection system</a>, and can lead to long-term psychological damage to the child
              and other family members.</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>You are asked to visit Amanda and her toddler Jakob by a childcare worker, who has concerns that Jakob is not
              meeting his developmental milestones.</p>
            <p>Amanda readily admits that
              <strong>she struggles to stay on top</strong> of her daily routine and to manage Jakob's behaviour.</p>
            <p>She gets welfare benefits but is behind on the rent at a public housing unit in the southern suburbs of Brisbane
              that she finds unfriendly and sometimes scary.</p>
            <p>She seems depressed and admits that she has been taking strong stimulants and anti-anxiety prescription drugs
              to "help her through" and sometimes feels like killing herself. Amanda says that some days
              <strong>she can't get out of bed</strong> to wash, feed and dress Jakob.</p>
            <p>She admits that at times she is on a "particular high" and plays with Jakob and buys him presents and other times
              she "can be off in her own little world and forget Jakob is there". One time she left Jakob in a shopping centre.</p>
            <p>She also struggles to manage his behaviour and has sometimes lost control and smacked him harder than she meant
              to.
            </p>
            <p>Amanda experienced neglect and abuse in her own childhood, living with a mother addicted to drugs.</p>
            <p>She tells you she loves Jakob and
              <strong>wants the best for him</strong>. She is worried that if she doesn't get back on track that "the same thing
              might happen to Jakob" as happened to her.</p>
            <div class="inline-content html-fragment full">
              <div data-interactive-impossible-choice-question="jakob"></div>
            </div>
            <p> </p>
            <h3>The outcome</h3>
            <p>In this case, Amanda knew she was not coping and was
              <strong>willing to get help</strong>.</p>
            <p>She went to a doctor who helped her detox and deal with her depression. Jakob went into full-time child care
              for a few weeks to give her a break.</p>
            <p>Amanda was helped to work out a payment plan with the public housing authority.</p>
            <p>Once she started to get on top of her problems, she went to a parenting education program to learn how to manage
              Jakob's behaviour.</p>
            <h3>What the experts say</h3>
            <p>Jakob is at risk of neglect, which Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows is the second most common
              form of harm reported in the child protection system.</p>
            <p>Neglect includes failing to give children the basic necessities such as food, clothes and health care, but also
              <strong>neglecting to supervise them</strong> so that they are at risk of physical or sexual abuse.</p>
            <p>Child protection workers can intervene with a child protection order to remove the child from their mother, but
              this is seen as a last resort.</p>
            <p>"Children are not necessarily safe in care and the outcomes for many kids in the system are very poor," said
              Paula Hayden, a social worker with 35 years' experience in child protection.</p>
            <p>Ms Hayden works with Winangay, an organisation helping to ensure that Aboriginal children remain with their family
              and kin.</p>
            <p>She said she would not remove Jakob from Amanda's care and
              <strong>one of the key reasons is he was attending child care</strong>.</p>
            <p>"What I need to know is that the kids are being seen by other people in the community. It's incredibly dangerous
              for children, especially babies, if they are not being seen."</p>
            <p>She said she would ask Amanda about the times that she felt she was
              <strong>the parent she wanted to be</strong> for Jakob, and consider what support services could get her to that point
              again.
            </p>
            <p>"I would want to gather evidence from other people in the community and assess her willingness to engage in services,"
              she said.</p>

            </div>
            <p> </p>
            <p>You attend a house in the outer suburbs of Adelaide to see Abby,
              <strong>a two-month-old Aboriginal girl</strong>, and Bree, her 22-year-old mother.</p>
            <p>But Bree is not home and Abby has been left with her grandmother.</p>
            <p>Abby's grandmother has bipolar disorder and a history of illicit drug use and lost custody of Bree when she was
              a baby.</p>
            <p>Bree is from Western Australia and her mother is her only family member in Adelaide.</p>
            <p>Just after Abby was born, the local police arrested Bree's partner James after an argument with Bree where he
              damaged a car and cut up her clothes.</p>
            <p>James is 13 years older than Bree and has a
              <strong>history of domestic violence and illicit drug use</strong>. He has agreed as a condition of his bail that he
              will not make contact with Bree, her mother or Abby.</p>
            <p>Bree had another child when she was 17 but agreed to share the child's care with their paternal grandmother because
              of concerns about Bree's drug use and parenting ability.</p>
            <p>A social worker visited Bree in hospital when Abby was born: she
              <strong>interacted well with the baby</strong> and agreed to use support services once she left hospital.</p>
            <p>Bree returned two days after leaving Abby with her grandmother, having been using methamphetamine with an older
              man who was known to police as a domestic violence perpetrator.</p>
            <div class="inline-content html-fragment full">

            </div>
            <p> </p>
            <h3>The outcome</h3>
            <p>Bree initially agreed to regular drug screens and to work with family services, but she soon returned a positive
              drug test and the decision was made to
              <strong>remove Abby from her care</strong>.</p>
            <p>A psychologist said that Bree had limited insight into the impact of drug-taking, domestic violence and transient
              lifestyle on Abby and did not believe she needed to make changes to get Abby back.</p>
            <p>She also said that it was important for Abby to form a secure attachment with a carer before the critical window
              of attachment closed at around nine months of age.</p>
            <p>Karen Menzies, an expert in Aboriginal child protection from the University of Newcastle, said Abby should have
              been
              <strong>placed with her family</strong> in Western Australia so that she had access to country and the community where
              her extended family were based.</p>
            <p>In recognition of the suffering the Stolen Generations experienced from past policies, each state and territory
              follows the principle that an Indigenous child should be placed with their extended family, their extended
              Indigenous community or at least with other Indigenous people.</p>
            <p>By the age of two-and-a-half, Abby had
              <strong>lived in five foster homes</strong> and had spent nearly half of her life being cared for by a non-Indigenous
              couple.
            </p>
            <p>After several failed attempts to reunite Bree with her child, Abby was eventually transferred to long-term care
              with her Aboriginal relatives in Western Australia.</p>
            <h3>What the experts say</h3>
            <p>Ms Menzies says it is important that Aboriginal children like Abby could expect the full protection of the law.</p>
            <p>"She should not be treated by a worker who perceives that any kind of harm is inevitable or cultural," she says.</p>
            <p>As Abby is an Aboriginal child, the child protection workers had to consider how to maintain and strengthen her
              connection to land, language, community and culture.</p>
            <p>There were nearly 17,000 Indigenous children in out-of-home care in June 2015, representing 36 per cent of the
              total number of children in care.</p>
            <p>Indigenous children are nearly 10 times more likely than non-Indigenous children to be in out-of-home care.</p>

            <p>You are asked to visit 25-year-old Belle and her children Tom (6) and Jade (10), following a report that Belle
              has moved in with a new boyfriend who has a long criminal history that includes
              <strong>offences against children</strong>.</p>
            <p>Belle is extremely hostile to any interference from child protection services and does not think her new partner
              is a risk to her children.</p>
            <p>The children's father has been located and he is willing to care for the children and has no child protection
              or criminal history.</p>
            <p>But he has had
              <strong>little contact with the children</strong> since he separated from Belle because things have been so hostile
              between them.</p>
            <p>There are no family law parenting orders in place.</p>

            <p> </p>
            <h3>The outcome</h3>
            <p>Child protection workers were concerned about the children's risk of abuse from their mother's new partner.</p>
            <p>They applied for a temporary court order and
              <strong>the children were taken into foster care</strong> while authorities investigated whether the children's father
              could care for them.</p>
            <p>This case shows the complex interaction between child protection law designed to protect children, and family
              law, which decides which parent should have custody of the children.</p>
            <p>Child protection workers cannot remove children from one parent and give them to another without the family court
              being involved.</p>
            <p>One option is for the department to apply for a short-term child protection order to keep the children in foster
              care while the father organises a family law parenting order.</p>
            <h3>What the experts say</h3>
            <p>Paula Hayden, a social worker with 35 years' experience in child protection, said she would want to know the
              details of the new boyfriend's offences but she
              <strong>would remove Tom and Jade from Belle's care</strong>.</p>
            <p>"I'd be worried about Belle being hostile to any interference," she said.</p>
            <p>"We know all too well that this boyfriend could groom Belle and because she's a vulnerable woman, he will target
              her to get to the kids."</p>
            <p>But she said women in relationships with men who have been convicted of child offences don't automatically lose
              their children.</p>
            <p>Ms Hayden said safety plans could be put in place to protect children so that the women agree not to see the
              men in their own home when the children are around â€” and sometimes relatives, like grandmothers or aunts, are
              included in the plan to protect the children.</p>
            <p>"It's giving them choice and control but it really is important to
              <strong>put the kids at the centre</strong> of that and hear from them about how they feel about the new boyfriend."</p>

            <p>You are asked to visit 12-year-old Jackson at home after his school reported he repeatedly arrives with no lunch,
              falls asleep in class and wears dirty clothes.</p>
            <p>He has

              helps build on family strengths and improve family relationships.</p>
            <p>Child protection authorities receive more than 350,000 allegations of child abuse every year. Around one in six
              of all allegations result in the children being put into the foster care system.</p>
            <h3>What the experts say</h3>
            <p>Social worker Paula Hayden said mothers, unless they were drug-addicted, often told child protection workers
              that they were worried about their children and wanted the best for them but needed help at home.</p>
            <p>She said the family would be given support services and it was also important to get the school to support Jackson

              <strong>immediately hospitalised</strong> and then transferred to a long-term placement with foster carers who had
              experience in dealing with children with high needs.</p>
            <p>Fiona and Gary were charged and sentenced to jail terms.</p>
            <h3>What the experts say</h3>
            <p>James's vulnerability was identified even before he was born and there had been three notifications to the Child
              Abuse Report Line during his life.</p>
            <p>But Fiona went to great lengths to avoid accepting help because she feared James would be taken from her.</p>
            <p>The family had no support and was
              <strong>very socially isolated</strong>.</p>
            <p>Social worker Paula Hayden said four key factors that were very dangerous for children were domestic violence,
              drug and alcohol addiction, mental health issues and cases where there were no services involved.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The names in this story have been changed and case details have been simplified.</li>
              <li>Social workers often have a lot more information on the child and their family than is presented here, but
                there are also cases where the information is limited or wrong and they need to rely on their intuition and
                experience to make a decision.</li>
              <li>Child protection workers have to work out the level of risk to children and also any protective factors, such
                as an involved grandparent or parents being willing to get help, when they make a decision to remove a child.</li>
              <li>The judgement to remove a child is not made by one person but a whole team, sometimes including police and
                doctors, and
